# 🏆 AI-Based Strategic Board Game

## 🎮 Project Overview
This project implements an **AI-driven strategic board game**, developed as a term project for the **CSE462** course at Yeditepe University. The game is designed for a **7x7 board**, where an **AI (Player 1) competes against a human player (Player 2)**. The AI is built using **Min-Max, Q-Learning, or Deep Q-Learning Networks** to make strategic moves and defeat the opponent.

## 📜 Game Rules & Mechanics

### 🏁 Initial Setup
- The game board consists of **7 rows × 7 columns**.
- **Triangle (△) pieces** represent the AI (**Player 1**).
- **Circle (○) pieces** represent the human player (**Player 2**).
- Each player starts with **4 pieces** placed in a specific formation.
- The **AI always makes the first move**.

### 🎲 Move Rules
✔ Pieces **can move horizontally and vertically**.
✔ **No diagonal moves** allowed.
✔ If a player has **multiple pieces**, they must make **two consecutive moves**.
✔ If a player has **only one piece**, they can **only make one move**.

### 🔥 Capturing System
- A piece (or group of pieces) is **captured** if:
  - It is **trapped between an opponent’s piece and the board edge**.
  - It is **sandwiched between two opponent pieces**.
  - Both players' pieces are trapped between opponent pieces, leading to **multiple captures**.

### 🏆 Win Conditions
- **Draw**:
  - Both players have **no pieces left**.
  - Both players have **only one piece left**.
- **Victory**:
  - The opponent has **no remaining pieces**.
  - After **50 total moves**, the player with **more pieces wins**.
- **Defeat**:
  - The player has **no pieces left**, but the opponent does.
  - After **50 moves**, the player with **fewer pieces loses**.

## 🤖 AI Implementation
The AI engine is built using **advanced decision-making algorithms** to maximize efficiency and strategic play.

### **1️⃣ Min-Max Algorithm**
🔹 Evaluates possible future moves and assigns scores.
🔹 Selects the move that **maximizes advantage** while minimizing the opponent's.
🔹 Can be optimized using **Alpha-Beta pruning**.

### **2️⃣ Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning)**
🔹 AI **learns from experience**, improving over time.
🔹 Rewards **optimal moves**, penalizes **bad decisions**.
🔹 Makes AI more adaptable.

### **3️⃣ Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN)**
🔹 Uses **Neural Networks** to predict the best moves.
🔹 Allows for **dynamic, self-learning AI**.
🔹 More computationally intensive but highly effective.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **🎨 User Interface**
✔ **Supports CLI & GUI** versions.
✔ Allows players to **input moves, view board state, and track AI decisions**.

### **📌 Move Validation & Capture Detection**
✔ Ensures only **valid moves** are executed.
✔ **Automatically detects and removes captured pieces**.
✔ Implements **turn-based gameplay rules**.

### **📊 Turn Management & Move Counter**
✔ Tracks total moves and **enforces the 50-move rule**.
✔ Ensures **AI moves first**.
✔ Prevents illegal moves.
